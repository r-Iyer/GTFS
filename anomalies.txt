The anomalies I found in the given data is that, no data is given about which bus stops a particular bus covers. Only the route id is provided in the Routes.txt static data.
So it is not possible to know how many different buses need to be taken from one initial position to another.

So what i did is after taking initial and final coordinates, found an optimised route between the two, and found the bus stops present in the route. 
On right clicking the bus stops indicated by the marker, the name of the bus stop is provided.
